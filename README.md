# Caesar-Cipher
The Caesar Cipher is one of the simplest and oldest methods of encrypting messages, named after Julius Caesar, who reportedly used it to protect his military communications. This technique involves shifting the letters of the alphabet by a fixed number of places. For example, with a shift of three, the letter ‘A’ becomes ‘D’, ‘B’ becomes ‘E’, and so on. Despite its simplicity, the Caesar Cipher formed the groundwork for modern cryptographic techniques. In this article, we’ll explore how the Caesar Cipher works, its significance, and its impact on the development of cryptography with its advantages and disadvantages.
